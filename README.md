# Digit Recognition Neural Network
 A neural network which recognises digits using only numpy and python

Created a simple Neural Network that is able to recognise hand written
digits from the MNIST Data Set. This is a relatively simple network using
only numpy and no framework. It only has one hidden layer and in the code
I have put a few different activation functions and the stats of how 
accurate the network was and the effeciency of each function. 

Using matplot I was able to show the actual digits to the user so they
can be the final judge of how accurate the network is during it's testing
period since some digits are - in my opinion - pretty hard to guess 
so the user can be the final judge of how good the network does.

With it's current state I've gotten a consitent accuract of at least 90%, 
depending on how many trials I do it flucuates but with even as low as 
100 trials it is able to get close or above 90% accuracy with the training 
data.

The only thing not included in the project I've posted is the actual 
MNIST data set I used since github doesn't allow me to post big files
and MNIST is a pretty large file so I'll provide the kaggle link so 
you can download it if you wish to replicate or improve my code since
I'm barely getting into machine learning this isn't the most optimal
code for this problem so improvements and feedback are welcomed in.
